# My blog

## A few words of introduction

I think creating programming blog entries can develop me as a software designer. To create a single post on a blog in-depth knowledge of the topic is required, each subsequent post will learn me something new. I would like to "test" my self as a blog editor.

## What do I use?

- [This](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) gatsby starter
