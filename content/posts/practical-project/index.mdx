  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Today we are going to practie JavaScript! Whooo! We will write a simple benefits analisis app. I do not want to create another to-do app so I used a little of my creativity and I came up with something else. How will this app work? There will be two <q>boxes</q>, one for pluses, and one for minuses. The user will be able to enter the advantage or disadvantage of the decision and define the <q>importance</q> of that plus/minus(on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 means it is not big advantage/disadvantage, 3 means it is big advantage/disadvantage). The app will sum up the <q>weight</q> of pluses and minuses and will show the information if the decision is good or bad for us. By the way this post is the first from series about modules, but more on that later. Let's go to the code!</p>
