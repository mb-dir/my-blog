  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>About three weeks ago we did practical project(<a href="https://myblog96921.gatsbyjs.io/simple-practical-project" target="_blank">click</a>). This post was the first from the series about modules. The previous one was more theoretical, so in this post(the last episode) we will rewrite this project using js modules, let's go!</p>

  <h2>Our plan</h2>
  <p>Let's describe how our project will look like. There will be one .html and .css file - nothing special, ctrl+c, ctrl+v from the orginal project. The differences will be when it comes to .js file(s), there will be one entrypoint file(index.js), and three <q>modules</q> or <q>components</q> - one will be responsible for form handling, another for showing the final decision, and the last one for addingthe user arguments to list. Okey, so we have plan, let's code!</p>
