<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Programmer (how easy it is to guess) is a person who create a code. Apart for clicking on the keyboard software designer has to take care about <q>beauty</q> of his <q>work of art</q>. According to the rule <q>small is beautifull</q> it is good to use a notation which shortens the code at the same time without reducing the quality and transparency of the code(or even improving it). I have prepared some examples showing how to imporove the transparency of the code and I will show it below.</p>

<h2>String concatenation</h2>

<p>One of the common problems a programmer has to deal with is showing the data to the user. Frequently the data are storaged in the variable, what in case when we want to add some extra <q>comments</q>? E.g. there is the user name in the variable, and we want to show <q>Hello [user_name]!</q>. One way to solve this problem is to concatenate strings using the "+".</p>

```js:title=example-1
const user_name = "Joe";

console.log("Hello " + user_name); //"Hello Joe"
```
<p>Ok, it doesn't look bad, but can it be simplified somehow? Of course! There come <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" target="_blank">backticks</a>(``) with help.</p>

```js:title=example-2
const user_name = "Joe";

console.log(`Hello ${user_name}`); //"Hello Joe"
```

<p>Fact it looks simplified, and it works even better when dealing with more complicated code</p>

```js:title=example-3
const user_name = "Joe";
const user_age = 22;
const user_hobby = "sleeping";
const user_current_job = "software designer";
const user_occupation = "teacher";

console.log(`It is ${user_name}, he is ${user_age} years old, his hobby is ${user_hobby}, his current job is ${user_current_job}, his occupation is ${user_occupation}`); //"It is Joe, he is 22 years old, his hobby is sleeping, his current job is software designer, his occupation is teacher"

//VS

console.log("It is " + user_name + ", he is " + user_age + " years old, " + "his hobby is " + user_hobby + ", his current job is " + user_current_job + ", his occupation is " + user_occupation); //"It is Joe, he is 22 years old, his hobby is sleeping, his current job is software designer, his occupation is teacher"
```

<p>Try to do something like this to see how `` are useful.</p>

<h2>Shorter if</h2>

<p>The if statement is really important and very often used by programmer. In js there is a way to shorten the if statment. The shorter if statement is great for not very complicated examples, but in more complex cases shorter if notation can give you a little headache. Below is a comprasion of these two notation.</p>

```js:title=example-4
const user_age = 17;

let information = null;
user_age < 18 ? information = "You are not adult" : information = "You are adult";

console.log(information);//"You are not adult"

//VS

const user_age = 17;

let information = null;
if(user_age< 18){
  information = "You are not adult";
}else{
  information = "You are adult";
}
console.log(information);//"You are not adult"
```

<p>There is only one line instead of 4 lines, and the readability of the code doesn't change, but in case where there is more complicated notation the shorter if can decrease the code readability, look here:</p>

```js:title=example-5
const user_age = 55;

let information = null;
user_age > 18
  ? user_age < 60 ? information = "You are adult, but not pensioner" : information = "You are adult, and pensioner"
  : information = "You are not adult";

console.log(information);//"You are adult, but not pensioner"

//VS

const user_age = 55;

let information = null;
if(user_age > 18){
  if(user_age < 60){
    information = "You are adult, but not pensioner"
  }else{
    information = "You are adult, and pensioner"
  }
}else{
  information = "You are not adult";
}
console.log(information);//"You are adult, but not pensioner"
```
<p>There is still less code, but is it still readable for you?</p>

<h2>Optional chaining</h2>

<p>The objects are the data collection, they storage the data in the form of <q>key:value</q>. Reference to the object value is really easy, it is enough to refer to the key after<q>.</q></p>

```js:title=example-6
const person={
  name: "Joe",
}
console.log(person.name);//Joe
```

<p>But what in case when we try to refer to the key which doesn't exist?(E.g there is some typo)</p>

```js:title=example-7
const person={
  name: "Joe",
}
console.log(person.naame)//undefined
```

<p>There is an undefined value, but what in case when we try to refer the property of property which doesn't exist?</p>

```js:title=example-8
const person={
  name: "Joe",
  address:{
    city:"Londyn"
  }
}
console.log(person.addresss.city)//Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'city')
```
<p>There is an error which stops the script. Of course we can use if in order to check if each property exists, but this if statement can grow rapidly. A little shorter way is to use the optional chaining, it is just a <q>?</q> before the <q>.</q></p>

```js:title=example-9
const person={
  name: "Joe",
  address:{
    city:"Londyn",
  }
}
if(person && person.adddress){
  console.log(person.address.city);
}else{
  console.log(undefined);
}

//VS

const person={
  name: "Joe",
  address:{
    city:"Londyn",
  }
}
console.log(person?.addresss?.city);
```

<p>Instead of an error there is an undefined value, so the script doesn't stop, and we can keep going. Of course with if statement it is also possible, but <q>?.</q> makes it easier. This is one of the way to use optional chaining, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining" target="_blank">here</a> is more information about this syntax.</p>

<h2>Destructuration</h2>

<p>Let's stay on the subject of the objects. Really often there is necessity to use a lot of properties from the object, we can do it like this:</p>

```js:title=example-10
const joe = {
  name: "Joe",
  age: 56,
  favoriteBand: "The Blue Stones",
  favoriteFood: "Pizza",
}

function showInfo(person){
  console.log(`name: ${person.name}, age: ${person.age}, favorite band: ${person.favoriteBand}, favorite food: ${person.favoriteFood}`);
}

showInfo(joe);//"name: Joe, age: 56, favorite band: The Blue Stones, favorite food: Pizza"
```
<p>But the constant reference to the <q>person</q> could be annoying. In js there is something like <q>destructuration</q> which allows you to <q>unpack</q> values from objects.</p>

```js:title=example-11
const joe = {
  name: "Joe",
  age: 56,
  favoriteBand: "The Blue Stones",
  favoriteFood: "Pizza",
}

function showInfo(person){
  const {name, age, favoriteBand, favoriteFood} = person;
  console.log(`name: ${name}, age: ${age}, favorite band: ${favoriteBand}, favorite food: ${favoriteFood}`)
}

showInfo(joe);//"name: Joe, age: 56, favorite band: The Blue Stones, favorite food: Pizza"
```
<p>One can say that there is one line more(and that is true), but the transparency of the code makes up for it.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I have just shown you some examples how to reduce amount of the code and increase its quality. Of course I encourage you to get to know each of the mentioned topics better, cuz it was only a <q>demo</q>.</p>
