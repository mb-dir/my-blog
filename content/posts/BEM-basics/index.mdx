    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The bigger project the more complex everything becomes, this idea also applies to something as(theoretically) simple as the class naming. It doesn't take long look for examples e.g. it can be so hard to come up with six diffrent class names for six level of header(h1 to h6). One can say that there is no big necessary to attach a great importance to class names or even there is no necessary to use class, since we can style this code:</p>

```html:title=example-1
<main>
  <section>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Click!</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>
  <a href="">Click2</a>
</main>
```

<p>Like this:</p>

```css:title=example-2
main > section > div > ul > li > a{
  color: red;
}
```

<p>And okey it works, but such approach is fatal in the long run. The longer you develop such a project, the less time you spend on the implementation of new ideas, insted of you will <q>fight</q> with attempt to understand what is responsible for what in css. One of the way to fight with such a <q>mess</q> are naming methodologies, one of the most popular is BEM about which this post will be.</p>

  <h2>BEM</h2>
  <p>BEM is a set of rules according to which we create the class names. In BEM we recognize three types of class names:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Block</li>
    <li>Element</li>
    <li>Modifier</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As you can see the first letters of class names types make up the methodology name. In order to understand BEM we have to start think little different about each tag - is this fragment indivisible and independent? Or is it treat like a part of the whole? Or maybe it is only modifier.</p>

  <h2>Block, element and modifier</h2>
  <p><strong>Block</strong> is something like component - it is a coherent, separate and reusable part of something bigger - really often component includes some smaller parts which are dependent on him(they cannot stand alone/they cannot be outside the component) and those smaller parts are <strong>element</strong>. The last term is <strong>modifier</strong> and it is used when block or element have to be modified(e.g in hover effect).</p>

  <h2>How to create names for block, element and modifier?</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of ways to create class name according with BEM, but they differ in small details(anyway the most important thing is to understand which part of page we have to treat as a block, which as an element and which as a modifier). Generally there is no rule how to create block class, but when it comes to element you have to attach the element part to block part with <q>_</q> or <q>__</q> and when you want to create modifier you have to reapet the class name add attach the modifier part with <q>--</q>. I know it may look complicated, but it is just so hard to explain. I hope you will understand this when you see some examples.</p>
