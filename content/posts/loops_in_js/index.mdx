  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Loops are one of the most basic thing in each programing language. Despite of <q>classic</q> loops like <strong>for</strong>, <strong>while</strong>, <strong>do...while</strong> there are some characteristic loops for JS like <strong>for...in</strong>, <strong>for...of</strong>, <strong>forEach</strong>, and in this post I am going to explain it for you.</p>

  <h2>Classic loops</h2>
  <p><strong>for</strong>, <strong>while</strong>, <strong>do...while</strong> are in mostly programing language, and they were described million times, but as a matter of principle I will describe them as well.</p>

  <p>So <strong>for</strong> loop looks like:</p>

```js:title=example-1
for(iterator_declaration; condition; incrementation/decrementation_of_iterator){
  //body
}
```

<p>And this loop <q>lives</q> until the condition is true, have a look at a simple example:</p>

```js:title=example-2
for(let i = -12; i <= 12; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
```

<p>And our output is: -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</p>

<p>But there is some let's say <q>nuisance</q> related with iterator_declaration - do you know? I will tell you at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Okey, let's go to <strong>while</strong>, it looks like: </p>

```js:title=example-3
while(condition){
  //body
}
```
<p>And <strong>while</strong> is performed until the codition is true - the main diffrence between <strong>while</strong> and <strong>for</strong> is that <strong>for</strong> has an iterator by default, of course we can easly rewrite the code from <strong>for</strong> example to <strong>while</strong> implementation:</p>

```js:title=example-4
let i = -12;
while(i <= 12){
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

<p>Result will be the same of course.</p>

<p>And our <q><a href="https://youtu.be/btPJPFnesV4?t=92" target="_blank">last known survivor</a></q> is <strong>do...while</strong>, as the name suggest it has a lot of to do with <strong>while</strong> and that's true, the only diffrence is that <strong>do...while</strong> firstly executes his body, and then checks the condition, se the result of such a code: </p>

```js:title=example-5
do{
  console.log("Hey Jude, don't make it bad.");
}while(false);
```

<p>is: Hey Jude, don't make it bad. When code: </p>

```js:title=example-6
while(false){
  console.log("Hey Jude, don't make it bad.");
}
```
<p>Shows nothing.</p>

  <h2>for...in</h2>

  <p>This loop has a lot to do with objects, namely <strong>for...in</strong> goes throught keys of object, so something like this: </p>

```js:title=example-7
const person = {
  name: "Joe",
  age: 19,
  favoriteFood: "pizza",
}

for(const key in person){
  console.log(key);
}
```

<p>returnes: name, age, favoriteFood</p>
