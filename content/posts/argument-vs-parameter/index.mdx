  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I will risk saying that the most confused concepts in programming are the argument of the function and the parameter of the function. Using these terms interchangeably is not a big mistake - in most situations everyone will understand what it is about, but it is worth knowing their correct definitions.</p>

  <h2>The point of difference</h2>
  <p>The difference is prosaic. The <b>argument</b> is everything what we pass to function when we call the function, whereas <b>parameter</b> is everything what we declare durning function declaration.</p>

```js:title=example-1
function add(a,b){//In this context a,b are parameters
  const sum = a+b;
  return sum;
}

add(1,2);//Here 1,2 we have to call argumetns
```
