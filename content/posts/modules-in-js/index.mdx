  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In the previous <a href="https://myblog96921.gatsbyjs.io/simple-practical-project" target="_blank">post</a> we created a simple practical project in pure JS. This project was created in the simplest possible way â€“ the whole JS code was in one file, such an approach to writing code is not optimal(especially for a little bigger project). It would be optimal to divide the code into smaller(reusable) parts. In this post I will try to explain this way of coding and bring closer the native modules in JS.</p>
