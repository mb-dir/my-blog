<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today we will speak about really important concept of JavaScript namely about <strong>scope</strong>. We do not use the scope directly, I mean we do not daclare scope like variables or we are not able to read the property of the scope, etc, but we have to know how the scope works. Let's break down the scope!</p>

<h2>The definition</h2>
<p>Scope is just a set of rules according to which JavaScript search the informations included in variable, but what does it mean? That means we are not always to refer to a concrete variable, if JS <q>doesn't see</q> the variable in the concrete scope this information will not be able for us.</p>
