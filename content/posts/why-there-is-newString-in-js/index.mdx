<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered why in JS we can work with primitive type like with reference type? I mean why when we want to upper the string we use <q>toUpperCase()</q> as if it was the method of the object when the string is a primitive type - but why? I will try to explain it to you below.</p>
