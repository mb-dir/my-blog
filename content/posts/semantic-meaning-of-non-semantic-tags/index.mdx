<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The correct use of HTML tags is really imporant, especially when it comes to screen readers. Thanks to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> we know the meaning of each tag - for instance we know that we should use &#60;h1&#62; as a main header on the page, but what about &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62;? What does that phrase: <q>the &#60;div&#62;element does not inherently represent anything</q>mean? Let's break it down!</p>

<h2>Knowing the definition helps in the correct use of tag</h2>
<p>As the title suggests if we know the definition(semantic meaning) of tag we know when to use it(there is nothing revealing about it), but what in case when the definition says that the tag has no semantic meaning? What I will write at first glance may seem contradictory, namly: the lack of semantic meaning of the tag determines its semantic meaning. &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62; are used where nothing else fits. When our page fragment cannot be considered as header, section, footer, main, sidebar, etc then &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62;(which do not define any meaning for page fragment) enter the game. Basically &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62; are used when we need to create some container(for instace for css needs(grid or something)) and nothing else fits. This characteristic &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62; allows us to create container which doesn't have any meaning.

<h2>The diffrence between div and span</h2>
<p>Ok, we know what's going on div and span, but what is the diffrence between them? First of all, &#60;div&#62; has display: block, when &#60;span&#62; is <q>inline</q> - that means </p>
