<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Git is a great tool. Each programmer has to know the concept of version control system. Git (or other <abbr title="distributed version control system">DVCS</abbr>) ensure:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The place where we can keep our code</li>
    <li>The backup copy</li>
    <li>More efficient work in the team</li>
    <li>Insight into the whole project history</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see there are a lot of benefits of using git, but in order to use the potential of git you need to follow a few rules whcih I will describe below.</p>

<h2>Take care of commit messages</h2>

<p>Commit message is a summary of all your work in the context of a given task. Commit message should describe your mindset when solving a problem. For example you have just added an if which checks if some value is Null, everything works, all test pass, etc so you do the commit with commit message like this:</p>

```vim:title=example-1
Add if statement
```
<p>You finish your work and go home, and then other programmer starts his work and sees some changes in the code, so he views git history and sees your commit. What do you think, is he going to understand what you did? Of course not, he sees that there is a new if statment which checks Null, but he doesn't know the purpose of the change, and when he looks in commit messages he sees only <q>Added if statement</q> which also will not help him understand the cause of the change. So what good commit message should look like? - The "receipt" is simple:</p>

```vim:title=example-2
max 72 character title limit

more dedailed description your way of solving the problem
with links to documentation/StackOverflow/other helpfull materials
```
<p>Why 72 character title limit? Cuz some git tools are not able to display more than 72 character in one line. Also when you are not able to describe the commit in 72 character that may means you did too many changes in one commit, and the commit doesn't describe one consistant change, but several inrelated changes. So the example should look like this:</p>

```vim:title=example-3
Check the user status

Due to the fact that user status maybe Null I add if statement which
prevents displaying the wrong data about user
```
<p>Remember, commit message is your message for other programmer. I am quite sure that commit messages can affect on the atmosphere in the team, bad commit messages = worse atmosphere/misunderstanding/irritation, good commit messages = better atmosphere.</p>
