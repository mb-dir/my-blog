  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Imagine that you are coding, all goes well up to a point. The code works, all tests pass, generally this is the life! And suddenly this beautiful dream ends. You see an error, it needs to be fixed somehow. You try to fix it by yourself, but all your attempts have failed. Finally you make the decision to ask in the Stack Overflow or something similar. You create a new thread, describe your problem and wait for answers. It turns out that no one has answered, let’s think why. There are two options, first: your problem is just too  complex, and no one can solve it, second: you asked the question wrong. In this post I will consider the second option, I will try to advise you how to ask good questions. As we know, the better question asked, the greater the chance that someone will answer.</p>

  <h2>A bit more precise</h2>
  <h3>Ask the question in the appropriate section</h3>
  <p>The basic criterion for asking question is knowledge about the category which it belongs to. This point seems to be obvious, but many times I saw the question about JS in the category related with C++. The question asked in incorrect section makes that people who are on the forum(who may help you) subconsciously will treat you as a retard(and they may be right, cuz not checking the section is a sign of a certain ignorance towards forum members), and sooner your question will be reported to the moderator than you will receive the answer to it.</p>

  <h3>Try to describe the problem precisely and concisely</h3>
  
  <p>Carefully describe your problem. What is the change at which the error occurs, what are the exact circumstances of the error, try to give all the nuances of the problem. Really often devil is in the details, so seemingly trivial information may be crucial to find the solution of your problem.</p>

  <h3>Put the code</h3>
  <p>The forum members are not clairvoyants, no one will solve the problem without looking at code, so put it! No, put the scrennshot is not a good idea, instead use codepen(example for JS) or(if project is big) put the link to the repo.</p>

  <h3>Describe how you have tried to solve it so far</h3>
  
  <p>If before asking you tried to solve the problem by yourself, let us know. Describe what you have done, and what was the result of it, put also the links to the sources you used – this will help to find out the potential corresponds more accurately to your problem.</p>

  <h3>Re-read your question carefully before final publication</h3>
  
  <p>The last glance, was everything important included in the question, does the structure of the question itself makes sense, or didn’t I make some simple fuck-up. It is always a good idea to ask yourself these questions before clicking "publish". Who knows, maybe at the last minute(after analyzing the problem again) you will find the answer.</p>

  <h3>When you get the answer that solves the problem, give thanks</h3>
  
  <p>Hey, someone took the time, tried to help you, do not be not of bi*ch, say thank you. These few words put a smile on his face.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I will sum up it in one sentence - ask questions as if you were to answer them. Have a nice day!</p>
