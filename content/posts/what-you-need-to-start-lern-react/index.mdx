  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Probably everyone who starts learning JS quickly comes across the concept of frontend frameworks. These tools are presented as a miracle cure for all problems. Very often, courses whose main motive is to learn a framework (e.g. React) advertise that the ability to write code using a framework is necessary to find a job - and it is true. Basically, these goddamn frameworks everywhere you look. So why not start your adventure with web development by learning one of them? The answer is simple: because we will not be able to understand the rules of a given framework well without understanding JS. In this article, I will mention a few key JS concepts that you need to understand in order to make learning React fun and effortless. If the issues highlighted by me are understandable, you can go ahead and start learning.</p>

  <h2>A bit of theory won't hurt</h2>
  <p>Not many adepts of the art of programming like to delve into more theoretical part of given programming language. Really often it is related with the necessity to understand confusing and complicated(at the first glance) definitions. However in order to start learning React you must have some theoretical knowledge about JS and generally programming. The knowledge about conceptions like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>declarative programming</li>
    <li>functional paradigm</li>
    <li>object paradigm</li>
    <li>this in JS</li>
    <li>the callback conception</li>
    <li>the difference between “mutable” and “immutable” data</li>
    <li>knowledge about components</li>
    <li>the difference between SPA and MPA</li>
    <li>scope and data hermitization</li>
    <li>imperfections of DOM api</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For sure will help to understand how React works and why we need to use it. So despite of the fact that learning the theoretical aspect may be associated with a sad period of study at school, it is good to have knowledge about those concepts.</p>

  <h2>Array methods</h2>
  <p>Generally array are common use in React, the reason is simple – ease of data storage. Also many api’s response take the form of an array. The most used methods in React are array.map() and array.filter() – those two methods make life of React developer more beautiful(okey, maybe not more beautiful, but much simpler ;)). So if you are not familiar with .map() and .filter() I will advise you to run for example CodePen and MDN and test those methods until you understand what it is all about.</p>

  <h2>Helpful JS simplifications</h2>
  <p>One of the first search result after typing “quotes about simplicity” in Google is “Nature is pleased with simplicity”, it is said that Isaac Newton one said. People should harmonize with nature, so let’s try to create simple solutions. Fortunately for us JS provides us a lot of syntax which doesn’t introduce revolutionary changes, but makes that the code structure is less complex. As you can guess React likes when we use that “simple” syntax. So instead of normal function as a callback try to use arrow function, instead of string concatenation try to use template literals, if it is possible use the ternary operator, also using the Object Destructuring makes that our code is more readable. Take a look at some examples:</p>

```js:title=example-1
//ugly, long version
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

const numbersSquares = numbers.map(function(number){
  return number*number;
});
```

```js:title=example-2
//not bad
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

const numbersSquares = numbers.map((number)=>{
  return number*number;
});
```

```js:title=example-3
//that's beautiful
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

const numbersSquares = numbers.map((number)=>number*number);
```

<p>destructuring and template literals</p>

```js:title=example-4
//it is awful
const person={
  name: "Pavel",
  age: 21,
}
console.log("Name: " + person.name + ", age: " + person.age);
```

```js:title=example-5
//it is great
const person={
  name: "Pavel",
  age: 21,
}
const {name,age} = person;
console.log(`Name: ${name}, age: ${age}`);
```

<p>Of course those code “simplification” do not end with the above four, but at the very beginning it is minimum which is enough.</p>
