Hi!

My name is Michał, I am still young(19 years old) and still learning software designer. I tie my future as a software designer with front-end technologies, I would like to create web applications. Apart from front-end technologies I really like using git, the concept of control system is interesting.

When it comes to non-technological aspects I study studies computer science and econometrics at the University of Rzeszów. My favortie sport is volleybal, and my favorite band at this momemnt is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thebluestoneswindsor">The Blue Stones</a>
