Hi!

My name is Michał, I am still young(20 years old) and still learning software designer. I tie my future as a software designer with front-end technologies, I would like to create web applications. So far I have finished <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact" target="_blank">this</a> React course, <a href="https://przeprogramowani.pl/kurs-javascript" target="_blank">this</a> JS course and many other minor courses available on yt. I am currently in <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/react" target="_blank">this</a> React course. Apart from front-end technologies I really like using git, the concept of control system is interesting. I have also finished the best(propably) <a href="https://kursgita.pl/" target="_blank">git course</a> in Poland.

When it comes to non-technological aspects I study studies computer science and econometrics at the University of Rzeszów. My favortie sport is volleybal, and my favorite band at this moment is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBQZwaNPFfJ1gZ1fLZpAEGw">Twenty One Pilots</a>.
